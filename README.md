it`s my program launcher
his home dir is ~/proprog
and config file is ~/ProProg/ProProg.bp
but you can modify the home path and config file path in ~/ProProg/ProProg.bp after #systemValues and you can add you programs in ~/ProProg/ProProg.bp after #ProgramsPaths
you can run it ProProg or using a sh file at ProProg/usr/local/bin/ProProg
after i will add a installer or some think like this
